Together they are called mysterious—mystery upon mystery, the gateway to all understanding.",

Difficult and easy support each other. Long and short define each other. High and low depend on each other. Sound and silence harmonize each other. Before and after follow each other. Therefore, the wise person acts without forcing, teaches without preaching. All things arise, and she does not turn away from them. She nurtures them without possessing them. She acts without expecting, achieves without claiming credit. Because she does not claim credit, her achievements last forever.",

Always keep the people without cunning and without desire, so that the clever ones do not dare to act. Practice non-action, and there is nothing that cannot be governed.",

    "modern_translation": "Being brave in being bold leads to death; being brave in being careful leads to life. Of these two kinds of bravery, one is beneficial, the other harmful. When heaven dislikes something, who knows why? Even wise people find this difficult. The Way of heaven does not compete, yet skillfully triumphs; does not speak, yet skillfully responds; does not summon, yet attracts; is at rest, yet skillfully designs. The net of heaven is cast wide. Though its meshes are coarse, nothing slips through.",
    "modern_interpretation": "There are two types of courage: reckless boldness that leads to destruction, and thoughtful caution that preserves life. It's hard to understand why certain things attract natural consequences. The Way works without forcing, responds without speaking, attracts without calling, and plans while appearing restful. Natural justice operates like a vast net that catches everything important, even though it might seem loose or inadequate to human perception.",

    "modern_translation": "If people do not fear death, how can you threaten them with death? If you could make people truly afraid of death, and you could seize and execute anyone who commits a crime, who would dare to commit crimes? There is always the official executioner. To do the official executioner's killing is like doing the master carpenter's cutting. Few people who try to do the master carpenter's cutting escape without injuring their hands.",

When plants are alive, they are tender and supple; when they die, they are withered and hard.

A tree that cannot bend will crack in the wind. The hard and the strong will fall. The soft and the weak will overcome.",

The way of people is different: they take from those who have too little and give to those who already have too much. Who can take their own excess and offer it to the world? Only the person of the Way. Therefore wise people act without expectation, succeed without taking credit, and do not wish to display their excellence.",
